This Project is a SPA intended as an intuitive resource for querying information about gameplay mechanics of the tabletop role playing game Dungeons & Dragons

Some of the features of this project are:

- It is Built using functional components and React Hooks.
- Queries the DnD5e REST API through HTTP requests and displays search results in a readable user interface asynchronously.
- Implementes a Node-based backend with Express and MongoDB for user authentication.

I decided to work on this project when I was a Dungeon Master for a Dungeons & Dragons game with a few friends. Many of the other resources for finding information about things related to the game have very complicated UI since there is so much content in the game. I needed something where I could look things up quickly and not be boggled by too much information at a time while we were in the heat of the game.
